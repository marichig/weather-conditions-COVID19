Instruction to replicate ABM results
1- Run the agent-based model in Netlogo, or through Mathematica using the [interfacing notebook](/COVID Simulation Support.nb) The outcome of Netlogo is true exposure/cumulative case under three scenarios of 1-3. 
2. Use the excel file “synthetic data -Test delay” to generate delay in reports. 
2.1. Copy your results in the sheets: “Synthetic confirmed – scen 1”, “Synthetic confirmed – scen 2”, and “Synthetic confirmed – scen 3”
2.2. The file generate reported cases on sheets S1-clean, S2-clean, and S3-clean. 
3. Hand-in the three sheets, plus data on towns (two sheets that start with town information) that include daily temperature and town density (the latter only be used in non-fixed effect regression). Follow the same procedure in the main analysis to analyze the data.
